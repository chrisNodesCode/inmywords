# Phase 5: Observability & Performance Budgets

## Goal
Institutionalize monitoring, alerting, and throughput controls that keep the modernized platform reliable under growth, using the stabilized APIs and frontend architecture.

## Task List

### 1. Logging & Tracing Foundation
- [ ] Select/confirm observability stack (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Datadog, Honeycomb) aligned with hosting constraints.
- [ ] Instrument API routes, background jobs, and critical frontend interactions with structured logs and trace context.
- [ ] Capture key metadata (tenant, route, latency, query cost) to diagnose slow Prisma calls and network waterfalls.
- [ ] Establish log retention, sampling, and PII scrubbing policies with security/compliance stakeholders.
- [ ] Provide developer tooling/docs for emitting traces locally and correlating with production runs.

### 2. Metrics & Alerting
- [ ] Define service-level indicators (SLIs) for request latency, error rate, throughput, and resource utilization.
- [ ] Set service-level objectives (SLOs) and error budgets per tier (API, background jobs, frontend).
- [ ] Configure dashboards and alerts that page on-call only when SLOs are at risk.
- [ ] Integrate metrics with incident response tooling (pager, Slack, runbooks).
- [ ] Review alert fatigue quarterly and prune noisy signals.

### 3. Performance Budgets & Guardrails
- [ ] Establish budgets for payload size, render time, and bundle weight across major surfaces.
- [ ] Add automated checks (CI assertions, Lighthouse budgets) to enforce thresholds on PRs.
- [ ] Implement API rate limiting/throttling aligned with infrastructure capacity and customer tiers.
- [ ] Introduce query cost analysis to catch inefficient Prisma patterns before deployment.
- [ ] Monitor background queue depth and processing times to ensure steady-state throughput.

### 4. Continuous Improvement & Communication
- [ ] Create incident postmortem template and cadence for sharing learnings across teams.
- [ ] Set up monthly observability reviews to highlight trends and upcoming risks.
- [ ] Maintain shared documentation for dashboards, alerts, and performance benchmarks.
- [ ] Provide onboarding sessions so new engineers understand observability tooling and expectations.
- [ ] Iterate on tooling based on developer feedback and evolving product requirements.
